        <br>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;color: darkslategray;">Ingredients</h2>
        <p>1 lb. jumbo lump or backfin crab meat</p>
        <p>2 slices bread or bread crumbs</p>
        <p>1 tbsp. mayonnaise (light or regular)</p>
        <p>1 tbsp. Dijon mustard</p>
        <p>2 tsp. Old Bay seasoning</p>
        <p>1 tbsp. snipped parsley</p>
        <p>1 egg (or substitute for special diets</p>
        <p>tartar sauce or cocktail sauce</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: left;color: darkslategray;">Directions:</h2>
        <p>Beat the egg in a bowl. Trim the crusts from the bread and break the slices into small pieces. Add these pieces to the egg. <br>Mix in the Mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, Cheapeake seasoning and parsley, and beat well.</p>
        
        <p>Place the crabmeat in a bowl and pour the egg mixture over the top. Gently toss or fold the ingredients together, taking <br>care not to break up the lumps of crabmeat.</p>
        
        <p>Form the cakes by hand into patties about 3 inches around and 3/4-inch thick. Shape should be like a cookie, not like a <br>
            meatball or golf ball. Place the cakes in the refrigerator for at least 45 minutes before cooking. This is very important <br>so the cakes don't fall apart.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: left;color: darkslategray;">Broil the Crab Cakes:</h2>
        <p>Slip them under a preheated broiler until nicely browned, turning to cook evenly, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: left;color: darkslategray;">Or saute:</h2>
        <p>Heat a small amount of butter or olive oil in a skillet and saute the cakes, turning several times, until golden brown or <br>about 8 minutes total cooking time.</p>
        <p>Serve at once with tartar sauce, mustard, or cocktail sauce on the side.</p>
